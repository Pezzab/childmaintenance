<h1>Child Maintenance</h1>

<h2>A custom WordPress child theme</h2>

<p><strong>Child theme that works in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/Pezzab/childmaintenance">Parental Guidance</a> - a Bootstrap and Hybrid based DIY theme framework</strong></p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/Pezzab/childmaintenance">Child Maintenance</a> and do a search and replace against <code>childmaintenance</code> and <code>Child Maintenance</code> to insert your own theme name (don&rsquo;t forget to change the folder name)</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/Pezzab/parentalguidance">Parental Guidance</a> and your newly edited child theme in <code>/wp-content/themes</code> and activate your child theme</li>
<li>Do all your Bootstrap editing using the files in <code>/mychild-less</code> or do your own thing. Import and compile your LESS files in <code>style.less</code> which will output to style.css</li>
<li>Use <code>Gruntfile.js</code> to handle and concatenate all your js scripts as required</li>
<li>RE template files: the idea is to avoid having to mess about with your site structure as much as possible. If you need to customise content just copy <code>content.php</code>, <code>content-page.php</code> etc. into your child theme directory and edit these, or create your own custom version (e.g. for custom post types) and an if statement or two. Ideally you only need to play around with content loops. Creating a custom template layout is for more complex needs.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>For styling the theme offers three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular 2 column centred</li>
<li>3 column centred</li>
<li>Full width single column (main content still centred but you have the option to style posts individually right across the screen)</li>
</ul>
